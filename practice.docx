There we have it. A comprehensive win for the hosts after the honours were even after both teams' first innings. Shanto went big with the bat and found great support from the rest of the batting group. Taijul continued from where he left off to finish with a ten-for in the match. They're off the mark in the new WTC cycle. Join us for the Dhaka Test, where they'll have the chance to seal a historic series win. For now, it's goodbye from me, Ekanth, Sudarshanan, Abhimanyu and Srinidhi, who've all been on comms, and and our scorers, Chandan Duorah and M Venkat Raghav.
  
Galib: "I didn't know that the next match is in Dhaka. Hope the pitch is not the traditional one. This Sylhet pitch was awesome! " Dhaka pitch is more spinner friendly if I'm not wrong. Fully agree that this was a great pitch.
